            The Story:
            <br>
            <br>
              During the gold rush, a man who had been mining in Colorado for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t struck gold yet and the work was becoming tiresome.  He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it had been left off. The new miner was advised by his engineer that there was gold only three feet away from where the first miner stopped digging.
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>
              The engineer was right, which means the first miner was a mere threfeet away from striking gold before he quit.
            </p>
              <br>
              <br>
              The Moral:
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>
                When things start to get hard, try to persevere through the adversity.  
                <span><a href="https://www.developgoodhabits.com/never-give-up-quotes/">Many people give up on following their dreams</a></span> because the work becomes too difficult, tedious, or tiresome–but often, you’re closer to the finish line than you may think, and if you push just a little harder, you will succeed.

            2. Laziness won’t get you anywhere
            <br>
            <br>
            The Story:
            <br>
            <br>
            “In ancient times, a king had his men place a boulder on a roadway. He then hid in the bushes, and watched to see if anyone would move the boulder out of the way. Some of the king’s wealthiest merchants and courtiers passed by and simply walked around it.
              <br>
              <br>
            Many people blamed the King for not keeping the roads clear, but none of them did anything about getting the stone removed.
              <br>
              <br>
              One day, a peasant came along carrying vegetables. Upon approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to push the stone out of the way. After much pushing and straining, he finally managed.  
            
              <br>
              <br>
              After the peasant went back to pick up his vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse contained many gold coins and note from the King explain that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the road.”

            <br>

            The Story:
            <br>
            <br>
            “People visit a wise man complaining about the same problems over and over again. One day, he decided to tell them a joke and they all roared with laughter.
            <br>
            <br>
            After a few minutes, he told them the same joke and only a few of them smiled.
              <br>
              <br>
              Then he told the same joke for a third time, but no one laughed or smiled anymore.
              <br>
              <br>
              The wise man smiled and said: ‘You can’t laugh at the same joke over and over. So why are you always crying about the same problem?'”

              4. Never let one failure from the past hold you back in the future
            <br>
            <br>
            The Story:
            <br>
            <br>
            “As a man was passing the elephants, he suddenly stopped, confused by the fact that these huge creatures were being held by only a small rope tied to their front leg. No chains, no cages. It was obvious that the elephants could, at anytime, break away from their bonds but for some reason, they did not.
            <br>
            <br>
            He saw a trainer nearby and asked why these animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away. ‘Well,’ trainer said, ‘when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it’s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.’
              <br>
              <br>
              The man was amazed. These animals could at any time break free from their bonds but because they believed they couldn’t, they were stuck right where they were.”

              5. Struggling will make you stronger
            <br>
            <br>
            The Story:
            <br>
            <br>
            “Once upon a time, a man found a butterfly that was starting to hatch from its cocoon. He sat down and watched the butterfly for hours as it struggled to force itself through a tiny hole. Then, it suddenly stopped making progress and looked like it was stuck.
            <br>
            <br>
            Therefore, the man decided to help the butterfly out. He took a pair of scissors and cut off the remaining bit of the cocoon. The butterfly then emerged easily, although it had a swollen body and small, shriveled wings.
              <br>
              <br>
              The man thought nothing of it, and he sat there waiting for the wings to enlarge to support the butterfly. However, that never happened. The butterfly spent the rest of its life unable to fly, crawling around with small wings and a swollen body.
              <br>
              <br>
              Despite the man’s kind heart, he didn’t understand that the restricting cocoon and the struggle needed by the butterfly to get itself through the small hole were God’s way of forcing fluid from the body of the butterfly into its wings to prepare itself for flying once it was free.”

            <br>
            <br>
            The Story:
            <br>
            <br>
            “In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10 year old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table. A waitress put a glass of water in front of him.
            <br>
            <br>
            ‘How much is an ice cream sundae?’
            <br>
            <br>
            ’50 cents,’ replied the waitress.
              <br>
              <br>
              The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied a number of coins in it.
              <br>
              <br>
              ‘How much is a dish of plain ice cream?’ he inquired. Some people were now waiting for a table and the waitress was a bit impatient.
              <br>
              <br>
              ’35 cents,’ she said brusquely.
              <br>
              <br>
              The little boy again counted the coins. ‘I’ll have the plain ice cream,’ he said.
              <br>
              <br>
              The waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away. The boy finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and departed.
              <br>
              <br>
              When the waitress came back, she began wiping down the table and then swallowed hard at what she saw.
              <br>
              <br>
              There, placed neatly beside the empty dish, were 15 cents – her tip.”
